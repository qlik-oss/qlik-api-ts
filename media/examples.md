Heres's some examples on common scenarios on how to interact with Qlik API's using `@qlik/api`

The code in the examples use ES Module Syntax. It is possible to use CommonJS format for the NodeJS examples, but we recommend using ES Modules since it's where the whole Javascript EcoSystem is moving towards. The code you write can also easily be ported between browsers and NodeJS when using ES Modules.
